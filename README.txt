Portfolio UX project - www.ayoubj.com

My portfolio is a bit like a window into my journey as a UX Designer & Product Designer—showing not just the projects I’ve worked on, but also the way I approach design. It’s not just about showcasing a few pretty interfaces; it’s about telling the story behind each project and the problem-solving process that led to the solutions. From the Office365 account management app I created for GEODIS to my work with associations, every project reflects a unique set of challenges and learnings.

I’ve structured the site to make it as easy to navigate as possible. Each project has its own section where you can dive into the details of the process—from understanding user needs and creating personas, to wireframing, prototyping, and gathering feedback. I wanted to make sure you not only see the end result but also understand the thought process behind it. Each project is a step in my growth, and I’m always looking to learn and improve, no matter how big or small the project is.

But beyond the projects, I’ve also made sure to share a bit about who I am and what drives me. I believe that design is about creating meaningful, user-centered experiences, whether that’s a corporate tool or a solution for a non-profit. It’s about making things easier, more intuitive, and ultimately better for the people who use them.

The portfolio is also a space where you can see my versatility as a designer—how I adapt to different contexts, teams, and users. Some of my projects are complex, dealing with big corporate systems and lots of data, like the GEODIS tool. Others are more about simplicity and accessibility, like the work I’ve done for volunteer-driven associations. No matter the challenge, I always approach it with the goal of making the user’s life easier.

To finish, this portfolio isn’t just a collection of work—it’s a reflection of my philosophy as a designer. I hope that as you explore it, you get a sense of my passion for crafting thoughtful, user-friendly designs that really make a difference.
